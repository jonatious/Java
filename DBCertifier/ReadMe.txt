This project was written and developed in NetBeans IDE.

MainProject.java is the main file to be compiled.
Args[0] should been assigned "database=testschema.txt", where testschema.txt is the input txt file.
Input file path can also be given in line 30.
I have not tried compiling this project in command prompt. I have also attached the jar file to be included for the project.
