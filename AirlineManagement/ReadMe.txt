This project was written and developed in NetBeans IDE.

AirlineManagement.java is the main file to be compiled.
Args[0] should been assigned nthreads=xx", where xx is the number of threads to be started every 10 seconds.
We also have another way of taking the input via a csv file. The args[0] should be "input" in that case.

I have not tried compiling this project in command prompt. I have also attached the jar file to be included for the project.
